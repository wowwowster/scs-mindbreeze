Version 1.0:
- First release

Version 1.1:
- Authentication Module modified to be compatible with new GSA 6.4 OpenSAML Implementation
- The RelayState parameter is no longer used
- AuthN HTTP redirect binding request is now decrypted  and parsed using OpenSAML API to extract request Id, Issuer Name and Consumer URL
- Those information are passed to the Artifact Register as Session Cookies and added to the Artifact Response
- Artifact Response XML was modified to add those new parameters
- Artifact Cache HashMap was changed to contain those new parameters
- Subject Verification duration can now be configured in the configuration file in the <GlobalAutenticationTimeout > parameter
- New required libs in the projects: (opensaml-2.3.1.jar, openws-1.3.0.jar,slf4j-api-1.5.8.jar,slf4j-simple-1.5.8.jar,joda-time-1.6.jar)

Version 1.1.0.1
- Added static AuthorizationProcessImpl.toAuthorizationUrlFormat(Repository, String).
  * Its purpose is to let any authorization process rewrite the URL it performs authZ with.
  * It was added to AuthorizationProcessImpl because:
      - it is the class all authorization processes extend.
      - it materializes the fact this method is supposed to be called at authorization time
        (because URLs need to remain unchanged in the Vector they come from since SAML XML response must return original URLs)
      - it doesn't force update of existingAuthorizationProcessImpl implementations that have nothing to do with URL rewriting 

Version 1.1.0.2
- Added buttons to choose between login form and public search when Krb negotiation doesn't take place

Version 1.1.0.3
- Exported html pages to resource files

Version 1.1.0.4
- Modified SAML Response in cause of authentication failure

Version 1.2:
- Added support for HTTP Post Binding Authentication method

Version 1.2.0.1:
- Modified SAML Response in cause of authentication failure (for POST Binding)
- Issuer (IDP Entity ID) is no longer the hostName. It was externalized in the configuration

Version 1.2.0.2:
- Solved infinite loop problem in case Artifact can't be found
- Increased Logging

Version 1.2.1:
- Externalized default DecisionStatus for unknown URLs. Configuration now needs to define whether unknown URLs will be given 
  the INDETERMINATE status or DENY status.

Version 1.2.1.1:
- Fixed NullPointerException (when no cookie, HttpServletRequest.getCookies() returns null instead of empty array).

Version 1.2.1.2:
- Added "throws Exception" statement to AuthenticationProcessImpl.authenticate(ConfigHolder, String, String, String) and to 
  AuthorizationProcessImpl.authorize(final Vector<DecisionQuery>, String).

Version 1.2.1.3:
- Fixed bug causing the RepositoryProcessor not to notify the AuthzProgressObserver that it finished when its connector is null.

Version 1.2.1.4:
- Fixed bug causing KrbGate to think configuration is invalid when file path contains ${catalina.home} or any environment variable.

Version 2.0:
- Added support for Subject mappings
- Moved all config objects to conf package
- Changed Vectors to ArrayList

Version 2.0.1:
- Version 2.0 fully tested and fixed
- GAuthNService: Check if login page parameters are present before checking if Authorization header is present 
  because in some occasions, IE re-sends the Authorization header when Posting the login page credentials.

- Added a Charset recognition static method the SAMLSPIServlet
- During authNn created a Cookie where the IssueInstant is stored in order to build NotBefore and NotOnOrAfter from this date instead of the GSP machine date (to avoid time sync problems).
- Added a servlet to reload configuration

Version 2.4

- Removed possibility to configure a Class name in Authentication section or in Mapper section. All processes must target a Repository.
